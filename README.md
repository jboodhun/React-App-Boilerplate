# Simple React Redux Boilerplate

### Built with Webpack Babel and Gulp under the hood

This is an experimental [React](http://google.com) boilerplate App that I use to spin my front-end environment when I am building new applications.

Here's how it's set up:

* Babel
* Webpack
* Gulp
* Nightwatch - Selenium testing
* Jest - Unit Testing
* JSON Server
* Redux
